title: Single-Winner Voting Methods

Lately, I've been finding a lot of people very enthusiastic about Ranked Choice Voting, without realizing there are even better methods available too.

So I made this table:

_^ Click for a bigger version_

There are also _"More Details"_ notes on some of the cells, if you click into them.

This one is especially intended for an audience who already knows about alternative voting methods, especially RCV-enthusiasts.

If you want us at [SIV.org](https://siv.org) to help you run a vote, we'll of course support whichever method you want.

Related: I also made [ApprovalVotingForPresident.com](https://approvalvotingforpresident.com) a few years ago, as a simple introduce for people learning about it for the first time.

Cheers, hope this is helpful
